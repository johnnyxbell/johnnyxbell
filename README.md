Hiiiiiii I'm Johnny an Frontend Engineer, a11y advocate, & speaker.

I've been coding the internet for the past 10 years and working all over the world. Over that time, Iâ€™ve managed people, been a tech lead; now, I love being an individual contributor and calling the Orange County home!

In the past I've worked for Weedmaps, StackShare, Doctor.com and FoyerLive in San Francisco CA, as well as Officeworks, DT Digital, IE Digital in Melbourne AU.
Outside of technology, I like going to concerts, hiking, relaxing with my other half, and annoying my wife by getting more tattoos.
